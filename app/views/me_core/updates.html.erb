<p>This week, we met with Dr. Vijlee to further discuss our concept for the kiln "assembly line". The meeting concluded with Dr. Vijlee giving us the "thumbs up" to move forward with the concept and begin diving into the details associated with the system. These details include, but are not limited to: how to create a flame/heat source inside the kiln, how to create stopping points for the barrels as they move through the kiln and what materials need to be used to create the barrels.</p> 
<p>Our main deliverable for next week is a Gantt Chart (timeline) of our milestones and targets for the remainder of the semester.  Also, our team will begin documenting the alternative concepts considered in order to provide organized justification of how we arrived at our decision. The documentation of alternative concepts are scheduled to be completed the Friday before spring break (March 4th).</p>

<p>This week, we made major strides in solidifying how we intend to heat elephant grass in order to make charcoal. To give you a rough idea of what we are considering, our design concept involves transporting "barrels" into a heating kiln and removing the barrels when heating is complete. By using a rolling motion to move the barrels, we will still achieve our goal of mixing the elephant grass for equal heating, while also allowing the barrels to stay closed while going through the kiln. This is important because exposure to oxygen will cause the charcoal to burn into ash.</p> 

<p> Next week, we intend to meet with Dr. Vijlee (our faculty advisor) to discuss our concept. Also, we plan to meet with Allan to receive shop training.</p>

<p>This week, we slightly shifted our focus from prototyping to researching the different ways charcoal can be developed. Therefore, we are collectively and individually studying the different methods that can possibly used.</p>
<p>Our team website is on track to be finished by the end of the day. If you would like the URL, please contact myself or Tim Miles this afternoon.</p>

<h2 class="sans">Week of 1/30/16-2/5/16</h2>
<p>This week, we met with our industry advisor, Tom Stein. Tom is the President of the organization that we are working with for our project. Attached to this email is the memo of that meeting. Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Next week, we will meet to begin our prototype design. We plan to test our prototype on February 15, 2016.</p>
